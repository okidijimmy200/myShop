Lecture 1:
Creating an online shop project
--Let's start with a new Django project to build an online shop. Your users will be
able to browse through a product catalog and add products to a shopping cart.
Finally, they will be able to check out the cart and place an order.

• Creating the product catalog models, adding them to the administration site,
and building the basic views to display the catalog
• Building a shopping cart system using Django sessions to allow users to keep
selected products while they browse the site
• Creating the form and functionality to place orders on the site
• Sending an asynchronous email confirmation to users when they place
an order

--For the price field, you use DecimalField instead of FloatField to avoid
rounding issues.
