Lecture 1:
Integrating a payment gateway:;
---A payment gateway allows you to process payments online. Using a payment
gateway, you can manage customers' orders and delegate payment processing
to a reliable, secure third party.

payment gateway we will use is called Braintree, which is used by popular online services such as Uber
and Airbnb
--Braintree provides an API that allows you to process online payments with multiple
payment methods, such as credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay

--Braintree provides different integration options. The simplest is the Drop-in
integration, which contains a preformatted payment form
--to customize the behavior and experience of your checkout, you are going to use
the advanced Hosted Fields integration

--Certain payment fields on the checkout page, such as the credit card number, CVV
number, or expiration date, must be hosted securely. The Hosted Fields integration
hosts the checkout fields on the payment gateway's domain and renders an iframe
to present the fields to users. This provides you with the ability to customize the look
and feel of the payment form, while ensuring that you are compliant with Payment
Card Industry (PCI) requirements. Since you can customize the look and feel of the
form fields, users won't notice the iframe

Creating a Braintree sandbox account::
--u need Braintree acccount to integrate the payment gateway into your project.

*****https://www.braintreepayments.com/sandbox*****

then log into
*****https://sandbox.braintreegateway.com/login*******

--Your merchant ID and public/private keys will be displayed wch will be needed to authenticate requests to the Braintree API

Installing the Braintree Python module::
--Braintree provides a Python module that simplifies dealing with its API. You are
going to integrate the payment gateway into your project using the braintree
module

*******pip install braintree==3.59.0********

--You use Environment.Sandbox for integrating the
sandbox. Once you go live and create a real account, you will
need to change this to Environment.Production. Braintree
will provide you with a new merchant ID and private/public keys
for the production environment
