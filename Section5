Lecture 1:
Creating a coupon system:
--Many online shops give out coupons to customers that can be redeemed for
discounts on their purchases. An online coupon usually consists of a code that is
given to users and is valid for a specific time frame.

--You are going to create a coupon system for your shop. Your coupons will be valid
for customers in a certain time frame. The coupons will not have any limitations
in terms of the number of times they can be redeemed,
--you will need to create
a model to store the coupon code, a valid time frame, and the discount to apply

Create a new application inside the myshop project using the following command:

************python manage.py startapp coupons****************

Building the coupon model::
Run the following command to generate the initial migration for the coupons
application:
**************python manage.py makemigrations***********

Then, execute the next command to apply migrations:
******************python manage.py migrate***************

--add the coupon to the adminstration site
